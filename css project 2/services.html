          <p>The distinction between a hill and a mountain is unclear and largely subjective, but a hill is universally considered to be not as tall, or as steep as a mountain.

          Geographers historically regarded mountains as hills greater than 1,000 feet (304.8 meters) above sea level, which formed the basis of the plot of the 1995 film The Englishman who Went up a Hill but Came down a Mountain. In contrast, hillwalkers have tended to regard mountains as peaks 2,000 feet (610 m) above sea level. The Oxford English Dictionary also suggests a limit of 2,000 feet (610 m) and Whittow[1] states "Some authorities regard eminences above 600 m (1,969 ft) as mountains, those below being referred to as hills." Today, a mountain is usually defined in the UK and Ireland as any summit at least 2,000 feet or 610 meters high,[2][3][4][5][6] while the official UK government's definition of a mountain is a summit of 600 meters (1,969 feet) or higher.</p>
          <p>Some definitions include a topographical prominence requirement, typically 100 feet (30.5 m) or 500 feet (152.4 m).[4] In practice, mountains in Scotland are frequently referred to as "hills" no matter what their height, as reflected in names such as the Cuillin Hills and the Torridon Hills. In Wales, the distinction is more a term of land use and appearance and has nothing to do with height.

          For a while, the US defined a mountain as being 1,000 feet (304.8 m) or more tall. Any similar landform lower than this height was considered a hill. The United States Geological Survey, however, has concluded that these terms do not in fact have technical definitions in the US[9]

          The Great Soviet Encyclopedia defined "hill" as an upland with a relative height up to 200 m (660 ft).</p>

      <div class="accordion-body">A valley is an elongated low area often running between hills or mountains, which will typically contain a river or stream running from one end to the other. Most valleys are formed by erosion of the land surface by rivers or streams over a very long period of time. Some valleys are formed through erosion by glacial ice. These glaciers may remain present in valleys in high mountain or polar areas. At lower latitudes and altitudes, these glacially formed valleys may have been created or enlarged during ice ages but now are ice-free and occupied by streams or rivers. In desert areas, valleys may be entirely dry or carry a watercourse only rarely. In areas of limestone bedrock, dry valleys may also result from drainage now taking place underground rather than at the surface. Rift valleys arise principally from earth movements, rather than erosion. Many different types of valley are described by geographers, using terms that may be global in use or else applied only locally.</div>

        <div class="accordion-body">Mountain ranges can be found across the globe on all seven continents. In fact, the vast majority of mountains occur in these ranges or chains rather than in isolation. The reason for this can be traced back to their formation: colliding or convergent tectonic plates can fold, bend, and distort Earth's crust so that parts of the crust rise high into the air. The result is a landform that, since antiquity, has inspired great attention: mountains.

  The word "mountain" comes from the Latin root mont and the Old French word montaigne. And the term mountain range can be defined as a row of mountains connected by high ground. Individual mountains must be at least 300 meters tall to receive this classification. And therefore, mountain ranges must have multiple peaks, closely related in position and direction, that exceed 300 meters in elevation.
  Nine of the ten tallest mountain ranges in the world can be found in Asia. The Himalayas are the tallest, followed by the Karakoram and the Hindu Kush. The Andes are the only non-Asian mountain range in the top ten; they are located in western South America. Ranking the longest mountain ranges in the world gets a bit trickier. The longest is the mid-ocean ridge, an underwater mountain range that spans over 40,000 miles. The second-longest is the Ring of Fire, which wraps from South America up through North America to the eastern coast of Asia. The third-longest, and the longest continuous land-based chain, is called the Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt, and it ranges across southern Asia and into Europe, a distance of roughly 9,300 miles.</div>

Often one or more sides have deep hills or escarpments. Plateaus can be formed by a number of processes, including upwelling of volcanic magma, extrusion of lava, and erosion by water and glaciers. Plateaus are classified according to their surrounding environment as intermontane, piedmont, or continental. A few plateaus may have a small flat top while others have wide</div>
